# New_Hello_World

This file will contain the four necessary folders that make up the new FitNutLite web application. 
The files will contain the Home Page, which directs us to where we want to go first. 
The first page contains suggestions regarding how food nutrients interact with other foods. For example, we rely
on a cup of coffee to get us started in the morning, but we don't always know that coffee strips our bodies of iron, which 
could be a problem if we happen to be anemic. And if one is taking thyroxine, they cannot have a dairy product or something with 
calcium in it within four hours of ingesting the medicine. This website and app with simplify your choices by showing how they interact. 
The second page is an imput for your food choices themselves, and the third page is for your medicine choices. The final page is 
an activity page, which shows what you should do if you want to see how to work off a food item. 
Enjoy!
